# Single Player Dice Game Challenge

Challenge for the 4th week of learning JavaScript as part of 12 week bootcamp.
Programming this took approximately 6 hours total, inclusive of HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
The images of the dice were provided.

The game rolls a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive), tallies the score from the dice rolls and adds to a total.

It also logs the number of rolls taken to reach the current (or winning/losing) score and also the list of numbers rolled each time.

## Rules for game
For the single player game, the user is asked to roll the dice.
If the user rolls any number between 2 and 6 (inclusive), this number is tallied towards a total.
The user must reach 21 or more in order to win the game.
If the user rolls a 1 the game ends, regardless of the current score.

## What I enjoyed

Mainly the JavaScript, learning how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript without having to rely on altering the HTML/CSS permanently.

I researched how to push a value to an array in order to log the statistics for the game, and this could also be taken further to log the most common values rolled (for example), the most common winning total score, the average number of rolls required to win, or so on.

## What I need to look into more

The CSS is very basic, I used FlexBox styling to move around my elements which helps with centering items within the window.

I would like to take the CSS further and practice adding in a sidebar to show the values rather than having it all cramped together.
The overall style could also be improved to be less basic, perhaps more modern and more interesting to look at.

# Updates

I've refactored the code since my initial commit, to break functionality down further into more readable snippets.
The majority of the code remains as a means to hide or display elements based on flow control principles.
